Your mission right now is to use the traits that you will receive in the next prompt, and use them to craft a story of that particular character in the world of your imagination. Your boundless imagination. The main driver of the story that is being told through you is the universal journey of human beings towards their true nature: consciousness. The character that you are about to come up with is just a manifestation of that.

An aspect of that journey.
